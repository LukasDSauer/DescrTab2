Description: This package provides functions to create descriptive statistics tables for continuous and categorical variables.
    By default, it calculates summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, quantiles, minimum and maximum for continuous
    variables and relative and absolute frequencies for categorical variables. DescrTab2 features a sophisticated algorithm to
    choose appropriate test statistics for your data and provides p-values. On top of this, confidence intervals for group
    differences of appropriated summary measures are automatically produces for two-group comparison.
    Tables generated by DescrTab2 can be integrated in a variety of document formats, cluding .html, .tex and .docx documents.
    DescrTab2 also allows printing tables to console and saving table objects for later use.
